# amazon-review-binary-classifier

In this project, you will be given product reviews from Amazon. Your task is to perform binary classification, where the goal is to identify if the text represents a high-star review or a low-star review. For the purposes of this task, we define a high-star review as one with a score > 3 (i.e. a 4 or 5 star review), with low-star reviews being <= 3 (i.e. 1,2,3 star reviews).
